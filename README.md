# JamMapper

Discover live music recommendations in your area! A recommendation engine embedded in a web app, JamMapper provides the latest upcoming shows in Denver, Boulder and Aspen.

### Why JamMapper?

The music recommendation industry for studio and album tracks is highly saturated with incredible, highly-tuned products that are built upon billions of data points. People everywhere use platforms such as Spotify, Apple, Pandora and the radio to receive music in a format that is built upon their previous music consumption. In other words, what you listen to today impacts what you hear tomorrow, popularized in such formats as Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist. However, I believe these formats either under-represent or pollute your music tastes. People consume music in a variety of ways for a variety of reasons, and it's incredibly difficult to distill what matters. Examples of noise include:

* environmental - your Mother listening to Michael Buble's Christmas album on repeat results in recommendations for Wham! Christmas songs (who's complaining?)
* historical - musical tastes from 5 years ago don't quite match up to today's exquisite taste
* different music for different moods - you like to listen to Nicki Minaj when you're working out but prefer a romantic acoustic mood for a live show

Furthermore, shows are a nuisance to research because you have to manually look at each venue's website, crawling through a list of lineups you either don't care about or aren't familiar with. Spotify has some functionality in this area, but it's congested with the above issues along with a lack of visualization for the venue.

### But Why Male Models?

JamMapper provides a platform for live music lovers to discover upcoming shows that fit their exact request. About a month ago Santana was announced at Red Rocks, an amazing venue in Colorado. My Dad has been listening to Santana for decades and I was quickly indoctrinated to the Latin rock god's jams as a young boy. However, the upcoming show sold out within minutes and we were out of luck. Using JamMapper, I was able search for recommendations based on Santana on the spot.
